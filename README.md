# Spot-detection-by-fastrcnn

This is a simple project that utilizes Fast R-CNN for fluorescent spot detection. The majority of the spots can be detected successfully.

The "og" folder contains the original dataset, which is divided into images and annotations. You can construct a simple data loader to use it. When using it, you can augment the dataset by applying rotations, and of course, there are many other augmentation techniques you can use.

The test results are as follows.
